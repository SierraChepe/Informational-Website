    <h2>More on Budgies</h2>
    <p>Budgies, also known as parakeets, are cheerful and intelligent birds that make great companions. They are playful by nature with the ability to mimic sounds and having a strong emphasis on socializing. Whether you’re a first-time bird owner or not, budgies are a great addition to any home.</p>

    <p>
  These birds thrive on interaction and stimulation. Budgies are social animals by nature and will need daily attention and playtime. They need plenty of toys for enrichment and company to stay happy. 
  If you’re someone who tends to be away from home for most of the day, consider getting a pair or more to keep them socializing — the more the merrier! 
  Their small size makes them easy to house, though the cage size should increase depending on how many budgies you own.
